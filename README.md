Hi üëã My name is N8 Swalley
===========================

Software Engineer & IT Application Analyst
------------------------------------------

My first coding experience was making a simple game in Scratch, a high-level block-based language. I fell in love with the process of designing, creating, testing, and debugging code. I was blown away by the fact that you can solve the same problem but in a million different ways. I quickly learned that the real fun is in finding the \*optimal\* solution. I've been a Bulldog for life; went to Brownsburg High School and then Butler University where I studied computer science, psychology, and data science. In college, I discovered a passion for learning, teaching, and helping others. I worked as a computer science tutor during my senior year, after being inspired by tutors that once helped me as an incoming freshman. I‚Äôm also very interested in artificial intelligence, ask me about my Bellman equation tattoo! I currently work as an IT Application Analyst at Arbor Homes where I solve problems for a living. I truly love what I do! I work as a part of a collective team to enhance the end-user experience. I challenge myself to be a badass every day!
